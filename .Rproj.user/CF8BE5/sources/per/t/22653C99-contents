Austin is a vibrant and upcoming city. It has a mulitude of things to do and see. My must-see places for Austin would be Ziler Park, Lady Bird Lake, Barton Springs Pool and Twin Falls. These are all great places to visit especially since Austin is warm most months out of the year. However, since it is almost Christmas, some places I would reccomend visiting are the Trail of Lights, Mozarts Coffee and the Four Seasons(they have a gingerbread village that is beautiful!)
There is a wide variety of restaurants and cuisines in Austin. For bbq, a place that is worth the wait is Franklins, be sure to show up early! Another good bbq place with a shorter wait is Terry Black's Barbecue. For sushi, I really recommend Soto if you have a few extra dollars to spend, but a more affordable restaurant would be Haru or Kome. Those are both great quality. Lastly, another one of my favorites for French cuisine is Epicerie, they have great homemade beignets.
Where to stay: 
Some of my suggestions include: 
Driskill Hotel
South Congress Hotel
Four Seasons
Fairmont Austin
JW Marriot
