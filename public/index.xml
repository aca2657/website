      <description>Austin is a vibrant and upcoming city. It has a mulitude of things to do and see. My must-see places for Austin would be Ziler Park, Lady Bird Lake, Barton Springs Pool and Twin Falls. These are all great places to visit especially since Austin is warm most months out of the year. However, since it is almost Christmas, some places I would reccomend visiting are the Trail of Lights, Mozarts Coffee and the Four Seasons(they have a gingerbread village that is beautiful!</description>

      <description>The 2 datasets I chose were about arthritis and epilepsy. I am interested in the medical field and have personal experience with both conditions. The arthritis dataset is about those that did a blind trial to see the improvement from a new treatment for arthritis. The epilepsy dataset is similar in that it is testing a anit-epilepsy drug called Progabide, however it is not a blind trial. The patients follow a routine check up to document how many seizures they have had while either being on a placebo or the drug.</description>

      <description>Angie Auyeung; aca26570. (5 pts) Introduce your dataset and each of your variables (or just your main variables if you have lots) in a paragraph.Salaries &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;~/Salaries.csv&amp;quot;)library(&amp;quot;ggplot2&amp;quot;)library(tidyverse); library(lmtest)library(glmnet)library(sandwich)library(plotROC)salaries&amp;lt;-Salaries%&amp;gt;%select(-X1)This dataset contains 7 columns. I took out “X” as a column as it is a counter for how many rows there are and does not contribute to the data. The next column is the rank of the professor indicating whether they are a associate professor, a assistant professor or a professor.</description>
